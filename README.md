# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I currently work in a position that requires lots of customer service. When it comes to user needs I always strive to solve not only the current problem, but also take steps to avoid the issue in the future. Creating user stories will help with this by knowing exactly what the customer needs and we can also document any other relevant changes that need to be made.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When I create a program I tend to look at it from a front to back perspective. I have noticed that this will work well for smaller programs, however I believe that agile based practices will be beneficial in the future. Personally, user stories are the most important aspect in my opinion since if a product does not do what the stakeholder wants it could be considered a loss. A way I could incorporate this is by double-checking with my professor in the future to make sure that my program does exactly what is required.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member is all about communication with teammates. If a team member is not pulling their weight and refuses to put in the required work that will also create issues in the Scrum.
